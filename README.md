### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Arthur, a passionate software developer from Brazil!

ðŸŒ± I have an unwavering love for mathematics and physics, and in my spare time, I find joy in teaching these subjects to children, unraveling the mysteries of the universe through numbers.

ðŸ’¼ I currently work at Mercado Libre, one of the largest eCommerce companies in Latin America, where I contribute to developing efficient and automated infrastructures.

ðŸš€ I'm also an avid open-source enthusiast! I have contributed to projects like WorldMoodToday, a unique platform that visualizes the global mood based on social media data. It combines data analysis, AI, and web development to create a fascinating snapshot of global emotions. Check it out at [WorldMoodToday](https://www.worldmoodtoday.com/).

ðŸ˜„ Another project I'm proud of is TodayHumor, a humor-themed community where users can share funny content and engage with each other. If you're in the mood for a good laugh, feel free to explore the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/arthsouza-meli/todayhumor).

ðŸŒŸ Your support through sponsorship will allow me to dedicate more time to these projects and contribute to many more exciting ventures in the future, helping us build a more interconnected and entertaining digital world!

ðŸ“« Let's connect! Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-linkedin-profile/) to learn more about my work and interests.

ðŸŽ¯ Together, let's make a positive impact through technology, education, and open-source collaboration!
